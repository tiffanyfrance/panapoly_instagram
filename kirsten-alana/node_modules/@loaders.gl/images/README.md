# @loaders.gl/images

[loaders.gl](https://uber-web.github.io/loaders.gl/#/docs) is a collection of framework independent 3D and geospatial parsers and encoders.

This module contains loader and writers for images that follow loaders.gl conventions and work under both node and browser.

More advanced IO support that handles e.g. stream support in browsers is being developed in this separate module.

> These IO functions require dependencies that can signficantly increase the size of an application bundle.
